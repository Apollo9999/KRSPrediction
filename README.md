## KRS Dam Water Storage prediction

This repository contains the work done in developing a predictive model that estimates the reservoir water availability at least 1-3 months in advance using hydro-meteorological parameters and reservoir water level data for Wave2Web Hackathon. The main aim of this Hackathon is to develop a predictive model to forecast water availability in the select reservoir(s) supplying water in Bengaluru, India.

We have collected weather data, land use, water use to come up with a model based on historical water availability, hydro-meteorological data, and water demand. [This document](https://github.com/Arghyam-Team/KRSPrediction/blob/main/Arghyam%20Final%20Report.pdf) contains the complete details.
